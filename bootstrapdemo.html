                    Jobs' design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism. In India, he experienced Buddhism
                    while on his seven-month spiritual journey,[232] and his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual
                    people with whom he studied.[232] He also learned from many references and sources, such as modernist
                    architectural style of Joseph Eichler,[citation needed] and the industrial designs of Richard Sapper[233]
                    and Dieter Rams.[citation needed]
       
                    According to Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, "Steve didn't ever code. He wasn't an engineer and he didn't do
                    any original design..."[234][235] Daniel Kottke, one of Apple's earliest employees and a college friend of
                    Jobs's, stated: "Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing
                    person."[236]

                    He is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent applications
                    related to a range of technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user interfaces (including
                    touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves, lanyards and packages.
                    Jobs's contributions to most of his patents were to "the look and feel of the product". His industrial
                    design chief Jonathan Ive had his name along with Jobs's name for 200 of the patents.[237] Most of these are
                    design patents (specific product designs; for example, Jobs listed as primary inventor in patents for both
                    original and lamp-style iMacs, as well as PowerBook G4 Titanium) as opposed to utility patents
                    (inventions).[238][239] He has 43 issued US patents on inventions.[238] The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user
                    interface with "magnification" feature was issued the day before he died.[240] Although Jobs had little
                    involvement in the engineering and technical side of the original Apple computers,[235] Jobs later used his
                    CEO position to directly involve himself with product design.[241]

                <div class="col-xs-1 col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 col-xl-4">
                    Involved in many projects throughout his career was his long-time marketing executive and confidant Joanna
                    Hoffman, known as one of the few employees at Apple and NeXT who could successfully stand up to Jobs while
                    also engaging with him.[242]
               
                    Even while terminally ill in the hospital, Jobs sketched new devices that would hold the iPad in a hospital
                    bed.[209] He also despised the oxygen monitor on his finger, and suggested ways to revise the design for
                    simplicity.[243]
       
                    Since his death, the former Apple CEO has won 141 patents, more than most inventors win during their
                    lifetimes. Currently, Jobs holds over 450 patents.
